# EcommerceErp
This project was generated with Angular CLI version 15.1.2 and node version 18.19.1.

## How It Works
To get the application up and running, follow these steps:

1. **Install Project Dependencies**
   ```bash
   Run "npm install" on the fron-ent and in the back-end part.
2. **Run the front-end**
   ```bash
   npm start

- This will start the Angular development server and the application will be available at http://localhost:4200 by default.

3. **Run the back-end**
    ```bash
    npm start
- This will start the back-end

# Additional Information

- Ensure that you have Angular CLI version 15.1.2 installed to avoid compatibility issues.

# Troubleshooting

- If you encounter any issues, verify that all dependencies are installed correctly and that the paths to your JSON data file are correct.
- Check that the ports used by both the Angular application and JSON server do not conflict.
